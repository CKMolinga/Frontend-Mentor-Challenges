## Overview

This is a simple social links profile page that displays a user's profile picture, name, a brief description, and links to their social media profiles. The design is clean and modern, with a focus on usability and accessibility.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Serif+Display:ital@1&family=Inter:ital,opsz,wght@0,14..32,100..900;1,14..32,100..900&family=Karla:ital,wght@0,200..800;1,200..800&family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap) - Google Fonts

### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned how to effectively use Flexbox to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. I also improved my skills in styling hover and focus states for interactive elements, ensuring better accessibility for users navigating with keyboards or assistive technologies.

### Continued development

I plan to continue developing my skills in responsive design and accessibility. In future projects, I want to explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts and deepen my understanding of ARIA roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of my web applications.
