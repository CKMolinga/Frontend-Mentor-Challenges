### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use Flexbox to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. I also improved my skills in implementing hover states for buttons and other interactive elements. Additionally, I gained experience in optimizing typography by selecting and integrating Google Fonts into my design.

### Continued development

I also aim to improve my understanding of accessibility best practices to ensure that my designs are inclusive for all users. Additionally, I want to experiment with CSS animations to add more interactivity and visual appeal to my projects.
