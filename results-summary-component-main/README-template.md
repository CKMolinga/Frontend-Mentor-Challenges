## Overview

This is a results summary component that displays a user's performance across various categories. The design is clean and modern, with a focus on clarity and ease of understanding.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned how to effectively use Flexbox to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. I also improved my skills in styling hover and focus states for interactive elements, ensuring better accessibility for users navigating with keyboards or assistive technologies.

### Continued development

I plan to continue developing my skills in responsive design and accessibility. In future projects, I want to explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts and deepen my understanding of ARIA roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of my web applications.
