## My process

I started by setting up the HTML structure and then moved on to styling with CSS. I focused on creating a responsive design that adapts well to different screen sizes. I used Flexbox to layout the components effectively. I also paid attention to typography and color schemes to match the design provided in the challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=League+Spartan:wght@100..900&display=swap") - Fonts

### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned how to effectively use Flexbox to create a responsive layout. I also improved my skills in using CSS custom properties for better maintainability of styles. Additionally, I gained experience in implementing a mobile-first design approach, ensuring that the layout looks great on all devices.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to further explore advanced CSS techniques such as CSS Grid for more complex layouts. I also want to enhance my understanding of responsive design principles and improve my skills in optimizing web performance for faster load times.

### Useful resources

- [Font Awesome](https://kit.fontawesome.com) - This helped me incorporate icons into my project easily. I used it to add star icons for the ratings section.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This website provided me with useful references and examples for various HTML and CSS concepts while working on this challenge.
